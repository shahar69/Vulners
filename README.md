Author: Shahar Eliyahu 👨‍💻

Vulnei is a research project that implements advanced obfuscation techniques for files. This tool can be used for ethical and educational purposes, and is designed for security research engineers who are authorized to use it. 🔍

The project is built using PyCharm and Kali Linux and incorporates a number of libraries, including PyInstaller, PyObfuscate, and Cython. The tool allows the user to upload a file, which is then automatically obfuscated using a combination of techniques designed to make the code more difficult to reverse-engineer. 💻

This project is not intended for malicious use, and the author assumes no responsibility for any harm caused by its use. It is intended for educational and research purposes only. ⚠️
